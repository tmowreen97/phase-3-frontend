The movie cards also have a delete button, so that you can delete a specific movie.

Next is the Add/Edit Movie page. This contains two forms, one to add a movie and one to edit an existing movie. Once you fill out the form of the task you want to complete, you will get an alert and be programattically navigated to the Movies page so you can see your new creation!

Lastly is the Add Genre page, which has a simple form to fill out about a new genre you'd like to add.
