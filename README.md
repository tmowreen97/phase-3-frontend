Are you a movie buff? Enter the MovieZone! Here you can create a display of all your favorite movies and share with your friends.

You could also add movies that you're interested in seeing so you can always go back to the MovieZone to help pick a movie to watch.

Here's a video on how to use the MovieZone <https://youtu.be/kcz9E44IfzY>.\

In order to install this application, you must have Ruby and Node Package Manager installed. Start by forking and creating a copy of this repo. Once you do that, you can click the 'Code' button to copy the SSH key and perform a 'git clone' with that *SSH* in your terminal. When you're done with that, you're ready to run the sever (npm start) and start using MovieZone!
## Functionality

You start off at the Home page, where it has the title *MOVIEZONE* and a brief introduction to the webpage.

Then on the Movies page is where the Movie List is located, displaying movie cards with the following information:
- image
- title
- director
- rating
- runtime
- genre

The movie cards also have a delete button, so that you can delete a specific movie. 

Moving forward, the Genres page which is displays the current genres we're working with:
- name
- description

Next is the Add/Edit Movie page. This contains two forms, one to add a movie and one to edit an existing movie. Once you fill out the form of the task you want to complete, you will get an alert and be programattically navigated to the Movies page so you can see your new creation!

Lastly is the Add Genre page, which has a simple form to fill out about a new genre you'd like to add to your collection. 

This is a great way to store movie favorites and share with your friends!
